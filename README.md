What's it?
----------
* Originally, it's a demo project for a Android/JRE(Windows,MacOS) cross-platform framework [ThinkAlike](https://github.com/tiancheng2000/ThinkAlike).  
* From then on, it may grow up into an enjoyable HearthStone Card Reference facility.  

What can it bring to us?
-----------------------------------------------
* For HearthStone game players, it provides the following useful features/functionalities: 
  1. Card Selector: Show game cards according to the selected Class (e.g.Druid, Hunter).
  2. Card Details: Show details of the selected card (in Card Selector) in central area.
  3. Card Selector Filters: Filters can be applied in category of Mana/Atk/Hp and **Abilities** (e.g.taunt, secret).
  4. Card Deck Builder (TODO)
  5. Card Composition Hints based on Might Calculation (Advanced)
  6. Automatic competition between Card Decks (Advanced)
* For programmers, it demostrates the further application of the ThinkAlike framework, exploring the easiness/uneasiness of doing cross-platform development.
